# Codsoft Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository containing the web development projects I completed during my internship under **Codsoft**. As part of this internship, I was assigned three beginner-friendly yet practical tasks that allowed me to enhance my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This repository includes the following projects:

---
